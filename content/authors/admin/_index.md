I am Abhijeet Rathod, a skilled and experienced software developer with a strong background in computer science and engineering. I hold a MS in Computer Science from University of Texas Arlington and a BE in Computer Engineering from Gujarat Technological University, which have provided me with a solid foundation for a successful career in the tech industry.

Throughout my professional experience, I have demonstrated my ability to drive innovation and growth in the software development industry. I have experience in various roles such as Graduate Teaching Assistant, Software Developer and Software Developer Intern, where I've developed several applications and systems that have resulted in increased efficiency and revenue. My work experience in various projects, applications and systems has made me comfortable with technologies like Java, Spring Boot, React, Node.js, Python, HTML5, CSS, SQL, Firebase and Android which allowed me to be a well-rounded software developer.

I am always seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and expertise in software development. I recently finished writing a book chapter on predicting depressive symptoms using various machine learning algorithms, which will be published in the book "Cognitive Sensors" in 2023. This has helped me to stay more updated with the new trends and technologies in the field. I also volunteered as an International Peer Advisor at the University of Texas, assisting incoming international students with orientations, and also leading orientations, providing guidance and support throughout the process for Fall 2021 batch. This experience of working with international students has helped me to be more empathetic and to provide a better understanding of the cultural differences.

In my free time, I enjoy reading and playing cricket. I believe that reading helps me to be more informed and knowledgeable and playing cricket gives me a chance to think creatively and helps me to be more focused. 

Currently, I am open to exciting full-time roles in Software Development and would love to hear more about it. I’m also always up for interesting conversations and experiences you might have to share. Please feel free to reach out and I’d be happy to chat about either!
